        <h1>A Visual Tour to Empirical Neural Network Robustness</h1>
    </d-title>
    <p class="text4G"> Neural networks are the most powerful classifiers for image classification tasks at present. To obtain such a classifier, one first needs to define a network architecture \(f(x,w)\)
        parameterized by \(w\) as well as a loss function \(L(f, target)\) where \(target\) denotes the real labels, and then perform the gradient descent optimization over the loss function to obtain 
        a set of (sub)optimal parameters \(w\). <br>
        In the visualizations below, we show how the loss value and the test accuracy evolve, and how the output probabilities change for 10 example images using a benchmark neural network 
        ResNet-18 [He 16] on the commonly-used dataset CIFAR-10 [cifar10] (the training detail can be found in [huimin]). Select an image, hover over the left-hand-side line chart, and then a racing bar chart 
        will display the changes of the predictive probabilities at different training epochs. You could find some interesting patterns there, for example, the prediction for the <b>Dog</b> 
        image (2nd row, 1st column) jump between <b>Cat</b> and <b>Dog</b> many times as the training goes.

    <p class="text4G"> Consider the situation where an input image is poisoned by some pixel-level noise that is imperceptible to the human eye. In general, humans won’t be fooled; but unfortunately this is not 
        true for neural networks. In fact, noises found in certain ways are able to mislead a neural network almost always, and one of the popular attackers is <i>PGD attack</i> [cite 2 papers]. As its name
        indicates, PGD attack is a gradient-based attacker. It main contains the following steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Start from a random perturbation \(x^{\prime}\) of a given clean image \(x\) such that \(\|x^{\prime} - x\|_p \leq \epsilon\);</li>
            <li>Update \(x^{\prime}\) by one step of gradient decent to increase the loss value;</li>
            <li>Project \(x^{\prime}\) back into the \(\epsilon\)-radius \(L_p\) ball if necessary;</li>
            <li>Repeat setp 2–3 until convergence or reaching a desired number of steps.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="text4G">
        Note that the \(\epsilon\)-radius \(L_p\) ball above is to enforce the condition that "<i>the noise is imperceptible to the human eye</i>". In the visualizations below, we display how the prediction 
        is manipulates and how the adversarial images look like at different steps of PGD attack. In most cases, the attacker succeeds in no more than 3 steps. Do you have any other interesting findings?

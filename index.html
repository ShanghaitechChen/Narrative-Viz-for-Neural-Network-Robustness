        <h1>A Visual Tour to Empirical Neural Network Robustness</h1>
    </d-title>
    <p class="text4G"> Neural networks are the most powerful classifiers for image classification tasks at present. To obtain such a classifier, one first needs to define a network architecture \(f(x,w)\)
        parameterized by \(w\) as well as a loss function \(L(f, target)\) where \(target\) denotes the real labels, and then perform the gradient descent optimization over the loss function to obtain a set of (sub)optimal parameters w. <br>
        In the visualizations below, we show how the loss value and the test accuracy evolve, and how the output probabilities change for 10 example images using a benchmark neural network 
        ResNet-18 [He 16] on the commonly-used dataset CIFAR-10 [cifar10] (the training detail can be found in [huimin]). Select an image, hover over the left-hand-side line chart, and then a racing bar chart will
        display the changes of the predictive probabilities at different training epochs. You could find some interesting patterns there, for example, the prediction for the \(Dog\) image (2nd row, 1st column) jump 
        between \(Cat\) and \(Dog\) many times as the training goes.

For that, researchers often turn to more sophisticated visualizations.</p>
